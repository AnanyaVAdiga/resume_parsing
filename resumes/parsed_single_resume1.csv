Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Equipment Using Advanced Regression Techniques • Predicted the remaining useful life (RUL) of industrial equipment using advanced regression techniques, including Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regressor, achieving an MAE of 5.2 hours. Agro-Sensor Networks using Database Management System • Developed and managed a database tracking crop conditions and environmental factors to assist farmers in understanding optimal agricultural conditions and the status of their crops. CERTIFICATES • Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA) • Business Intelligence using Power BI OTHER ACTIVITIES • Participated in a 24-hour global contest Gameathon 5.0 • Completed a 1-month virtual internship with the Pledge a Smile Foundation (NGO) ","EDUCATION B.E- Information Science and Engineering Jyothy Institute of Technology CGPA — 8.56 (5 semesters) 2021-Present Deeksha CFL PU College Percentage — 86.5% Rashtrotthana Vidya Kendra Percentage — 80% TECHNICAL SKILLS Programming Languages: Python, C Operating System: Windows, Linux Database: SQL Machine Learning Visualization tool: Power BI ACADEMIC PROJECTS June 2021 May 2019 Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning Algorithms • Utilized Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree classifiers to evaluate their efficacy in predicting credit card fraud. • Employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to refine feature representation and reduce dimensionality. • Applied Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to enhance the interpretability of model predictions. • Implemented Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to visualize high-dimensional data effectively.
